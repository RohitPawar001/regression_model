## Model Information

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship, represented by the equation \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the intercept. The goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values. It's widely used for predictive analysis and identifying trends. Linear regression is simple yet powerful, making it a fundamental tool in data science and machine learning.
